   _initialize function that calls __wasm_call_ctors is required to mitigade memory leak
   that is described in https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/issues/298

   In short, without this code rust wraps every export function
   with __wasm_call_ctors/__wasm_call_dtors calls. This causes memory leaks. When compiler sees
   an explicit call to __wasm_call_ctors in _initialize function, it disables export wrapping.

   TODO: remove when updating to marine-rs-sdk with fix
